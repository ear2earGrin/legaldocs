ABOUT the COOKIE process:
• Prior and explicit consent must be obtained before any activation of cookies (apart from whitelisted, necessary cookies).
• Consents must be granular, i.e. users must be able to activate some cookies rather than others and not be forced to consent to either all or none. (For example here u have check options like: / necessary / statistics / marketing / preferences / But you also a lets say appealing green button saying “allow all cookies” above them) (design doesnt matter) U just need to have the option for them to choose.
• Consent must be freely given, i.e. not allowed to be forced.
• Consents must be as easily withdrawn as they are given.
• Consents must be securely stored as legal documentation.
• Consent must be renewed at least once per year.
