We may use your personal information to send direct marketing only where you have provided your consent or otherwise when we are permitted by applicable law to do so. If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries outside of the EEA and Switzerland. 
In all such cases, we will only transfer your personal information if: 
• The country to which the personal information will be transferred has been granted a European Commission adequacy decision;
 • The recipient of the personal information is located in the U.S. and has certified to the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework; or
 • We have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the transfer, for example the EU Model Contracts. You may request a copy of the safeguards that we have put in place in respect of transfers of personal data by contacting us as described in the How to Contact Us section below.

Your request should include any information relevant to your request, including, without limitation: (i) your name, email, and postal address; (ii) the specific right you are asserting (e.g., removal); and (iii) if you are requesting removal, a brief explanation of why you believe such information should be removed. To assist us in processing your request in a timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so.
To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that verifies your identity - a utility bill or similar mailing will suffice. You may also obscure parts of the document such as identifying numbers so long as the document continues to clearly identify you. If you are making the request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide evidence of your authority to make such a request. All requests for removal will be reviewed by our legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
How We Protect Your Information

We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. We also limit access to information about you solely to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products and services to you, or in order to do their jobs. Keep in mind that because no security can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we have collected from you. If you have reason to believe that the personal information that we hold about you is no longer secure, please contact us immediately as described in this Privacy Policy.
In case of a data breach
If we have reason to suspect our systems have been breached and personal information has been obtained by third parties such that poses risk to an individual’s rights and freedoms, __Company__ will notify the supervisory authority without undue delay, and at the latest within 72 hours after having become aware of the breach. 
If the data breach poses a high risk to those individuals affected we will inform of the breach and type of data obtain via e-mail or on our website, unless there are effective technical and organisational protection measures that have been put in place, or other measures that ensure that the risk is no longer likely to materialise.
__Company__ implements appropriate technical and organisational measures to avoid possible data breaches.

The Website is controlled and offered by __Company__ Inc. from the United States of America, and, regardless of your place of residence, your use of them is governed by the law of the State of Texas, USA. __Company__ makes no representations that the Website is appropriate for use in other locations or are legal in all jurisdictions.

International Data Transfer

If you are receiving the Services from outside the United States, your personal data will be transferred to and stored in our servers in the U.S. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy. 
Further, if you are receiving the Services from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) we note that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country that is not regarded as providing the same level of protection for personal information as the laws of your home country, and may be available to the government of those countries under a lawful order made in those countries. 
We have put in place appropriate safeguards (such as contractual commitments) in accordance with applicable legal requirements to provide adequate protections for your personal information. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries. We may also transfer data to the U.S. under the Privacy Shield framework which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EU and the US.
